Implementation of singly-connected linked list in C++.
Test code has to be improved.
The list is 0-based list; the first element is at index 0.

It uses template class, therefore, data can be any type.

you can play around with it by editing the testLinkedList.cpp.
and just do:

```
make
./test
```
