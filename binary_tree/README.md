Implementation of binary tree in C++.
The implementation is in the header file, not in cpp file because of template class used in the implementation.(did not want to include cpp file in the test file)
Test code has to be improved.

Again, it uses template class, therefore, data can be any type.

you can play around with it by editing the testBinaryTree.cpp.
and just do:

```
make
./test
```
